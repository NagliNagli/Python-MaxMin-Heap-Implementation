# MaxMin Heap Python Implementation
Hello everyone,
in this repository i will share my MaxMin heap implementation written in python. 

Which was presented to me as an assignment on Data Structures and intro to Algorithms University Course

The code is based on the following paper (which is related to MinMax Heap)
